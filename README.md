# A Conversational User Interface For Destiny

> Disclaimer : `There won't be source code releases for the newer versions.` Project Destiny is not an open-sourced Project, and you will be only witnessing the results and milestones of development that we have and are yet to be completed. Thank You.


`This repository contains the first phase of basic rule-based skeleton integrated into a simple light weight GUI for Destiny.`

---

The goal was to create a Cross-Platform supported Graphical Conversational User Interface for Destiny so that the users can visualize the input command and its corresponding output generated by Destiny. The GUI is designed using the Electron.js a Node.js based Desktop application with cross platform compatibility and minimal system resource usage. We have also created two new concepts that is the baseline for Destiny's entire Architectural design.<br/>

**Destiny's Base Architectural Concepts**


- [Destiny_FrameWork (Reffered To As : Front-End)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framework)
- [Destiny_Main_Frame (Reffered To As : Back-End)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mainframe_computer)

Integrating ChatterBot and its corpus into Destiny's Main_Frame opened-up new possibilites to testing and tweaking around with the Framework, which helped us understand more of having the need for a User Interface. Checkout our Work Below to know more.

## Built-in Commands

```
DESTINY | HONEY
WHATS THE TIME
PLAY MUSIC
THANK YOU
SHUTDOWN | KILL POWER
RESTART
LOGOFF | INITIATE SECURITY LOCKDDOWN | SECURITY LOCKDOWN
CHATTERBOT - COMMANDS (FOR NATURAL CONVERSATION) | CHATTERBOT CORPUS COMMANDS
BYE | QUIT
```

## Features

- `Cross-platform` targeted design configuration.
- Simple speech engine and easy to configure.
- `Sapi5` voice support.
- Uses `Ivona Text To Speech Engine` Voices.
- `Works Completely Offline.`
- Threaded Speech with Printing on command line.
- Adaptive Hotword Reply (Greet By Time).
- Added Shell Commands (Trial for system integrated functions like - Shutdown & Restart).
- GUI - `Designed For Crossplatform usages.`
- `Transparent GUI` (So it doesnt block your vision and can keep u occupied with your work).
- GUI design is clean and made compact ready with `Minimal System Resourse Usages.`
- GUI - `Responsive Buttons.`

## Destiny's Framework Test Results

    <p>The basic user interface is made clean slate with minimal windowsize and transparent background. The GUI consists of a text input label box which is button free so that you can enter the commands directly using the "Enter" key. The minimalistic GUI with lower opacity helps to work as overlay on your workspace across the desktop when you needed her. The glowy Sci-fi look makes it Futuristic.<hr></hr></p></details>

    <p>The GUI has only allocated 20mb of RAM for the current test run as the functions are minimal. There might be chances of slight increase in resource consumption when background monitoring and additional functions gets implemented. This beta version is not the final review for how the interfaces are to be like. Stay tuned for further updates in the Future.<hr></hr></p></details>
